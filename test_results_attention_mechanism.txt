=== Attention Mechanism System Tests ===

1. Testing Basic Component Functionality...
SalienceDetector initialized for bottom-up attention
  âœ… SalienceDetector creation and processing
TopDownAttention initialized for goal-driven attention
  âœ… TopDownAttention creation and goal setting

2. Testing Attention Controller Integration...
SalienceDetector initialized for bottom-up attention
TopDownAttention initialized for goal-driven attention
AttentionController initialized with integrated attention mechanisms
  âœ… AttentionController initialization
  âœ… Basic attention processing

3. Testing Bottom-Up Attention...
  âœ… Contrast detection: max salience = 0.945
  âœ… Temporal change detection

4. Testing Top-Down Attention...
  âœ… Top-down bias generation: strength = 6.740
  âœ… Goal management and clearing

5. Testing Attention Dynamics...
SalienceDetector initialized for bottom-up attention
TopDownAttention initialized for goal-driven attention
AttentionController initialized with integrated attention mechanisms
  âœ… Attention switching: states = ['idle', 'focused']
  âœ… Inhibition effects: 0 inhibited locations

âœ… All Attention Mechanism tests passed!

ðŸŽ‰ Task 8: Attention Mechanism Implementation
All tests passed - attention mechanism validated!

Key features validated:
  â€¢ Bottom-up salience detection with contrast and motion
  â€¢ Top-down goal-driven attention with feature templates
  â€¢ Integrated attention control with switching dynamics
  â€¢ Inhibition of return preventing immediate re-attention
  â€¢ Spatial and temporal attention mechanisms
