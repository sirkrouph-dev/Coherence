# Requirements Document: Enhanced Neuromorphic Brain Learning

## Introduction

This specification transforms the current Coherence neuromorphic framework from its current balanced competitive learning success into a more biologically realistic brain learning simulation. The current system successfully addresses the binding problem with 100% concept accuracy and 0.986 attractor stability - this is an excellent foundation to build upon.

The goal is to incrementally enhance biological realism while maintaining the system's current strengths, focusing on practical improvements that can be implemented by a solo developer over 6-12 months. We'll prioritize features that are most likely to produce emergent properties and interesting behaviors.
