## 🚧 In Progress

### Unit Tests (Partially Complete)
**Status:** Tests written but need updates to match actual implementation

**Issues Found:**
1. Neuron models use different attribute names:
   - `membrane_potential` instead of `v`
   - `adaptation_current` instead of `w`
2. Neuron type strings differ from expected
3. Some methods have different signatures

**Current Test Results:**
- Neuron tests: 7/22 passing (32%)
- Synapse tests: Not yet run
- Security tests: 5/5 passing (100%)
