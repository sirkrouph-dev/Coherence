## Summary Statistics

- **Fully Implemented (✔)**: 18 items (36%)
- **Partially Implemented (◑)**: 14 items (28%)  
- **Missing/Unsubstantiated (✘)**: 18 items (36%)

## Critical Gaps

### High Priority Issues
1. **No performance benchmarks** - The claimed 1000× speedup has no supporting evidence
2. **Visualization missing** - The entire visualization module doesn't exist
3. **Import errors** - Many core classes fail to import (test_baseline_results.json)
4. **Power/memory claims unverified** - No actual measurements of the claimed efficiency

### Medium Priority Issues
1. **Incomplete neuromodulation** - Cholinergic system incomplete, Noradrenergic missing
2. **Hardware compatibility** - Loihi/TrueNorth support is documentation-only
3. **Limited testing** - Most tests fail with import errors
4. **GPU acceleration uncertain** - Falls back to CPU silently

### Low Priority Issues
1. **Meta-learning not implemented** - Listed as future work
2. **Some connection types missing** - Recurrent connections not implemented
3. **Documentation inconsistencies** - Code doesn't match specification in places

## Recommendations

1. **Immediate**: Fix import errors and get basic tests passing
2. **Short-term**: Add actual benchmarking to validate performance claims
3. **Medium-term**: Complete missing implementations (visualization, missing neuromodulators)
4. **Long-term**: Add hardware platform support if truly needed

## Notes

- The codebase shows significant effort but many features are incomplete or untested
- Performance claims appear to be aspirational rather than measured
- The Jetson optimization exists but likely doesn't work on actual hardware
- Many sophisticated features (AdEx neurons, STDP) are well-implemented
- The gap between documentation claims and implementation is substantial
