# Archive Directory

This directory contains archived prototypes, experiments, and historical documentation from the neuromorphic simulation system's development phase.

## Directory Structure

### prototypes/
Contains early prototype implementations and test scripts that were used during the proof-of-concept phase:
- `test_baseline.py` - Original baseline testing script
- `test_enhanced_system.py` - Enhanced system testing
- `test_gpu_neurons.py` - GPU neuron implementation tests
- `test_neuromodulation_encoding.py` - Neuromodulation encoding tests
- `test_security_fixes.py` - Security testing scripts
- `analyze_dependencies.py` - Dependency analysis tool
- `analyze_type_hints_docs.py` - Type hint documentation analyzer
- `check_classes.py` - Class structure checker
- `verify_environment.py` - Environment verification script

### experiments/
Reserved for experimental code that didn't make it into production but may have historical or reference value.

### reports/
Contains technical reports and documentation from the development phase:
- `claims_vs_implementation_matrix.md` - Implementation validation matrix
- `core_inspection_report.md` - Core system inspection report
- `security_robustness_review.md` - Security and robustness review
- `static_analysis_report.md` - Static code analysis results
- `system_specifications.md` - Original system specifications
- `TECHNICAL_ASSESSMENT_REPORT.md` - Technical assessment documentation
- `test_baseline_report.md` - Baseline test results
- `IMPLEMENTATION_PROGRESS.md` - Implementation progress tracking
- `SECURITY_FIXES_IMPLEMENTED.md` - Security fixes documentation
- `GPU_SCALING_REPORT.md` - GPU scaling analysis

## Purpose

These files are preserved for:
1. **Historical Reference**: Understanding the evolution of the system
2. **Code Recovery**: Retrieving useful snippets or algorithms if needed
3. **Documentation**: Maintaining a record of design decisions and experiments
4. **Audit Trail**: Preserving the development history for compliance or review

## Note

These files are no longer part of the active codebase and should not be used in production. For current implementations, refer to the main `src/` directory structure.
