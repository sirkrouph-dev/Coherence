ðŸŽ‰ Task 7: Working Memory System Implementation
All tests passed - working memory system validated!

Key features validated:
  â€¢ Limited capacity buffers (3-7 items)
  â€¢ Persistent activity patterns with decay
  â€¢ Inter-buffer interference effects
  â€¢ Attention-based control and allocation
  â€¢ Memory refresh and maintenance mechanisms
