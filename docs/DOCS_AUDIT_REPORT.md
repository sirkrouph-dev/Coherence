# Documentation Audit Report

## Summary
After reviewing the documentation against the current codebase, I found several inconsistencies and outdated information that need to be corrected.

## Issues Found

### 1. **Encoding Documentation Mismatch** ❌

**File**: `docs/tutorials/02_sensory_encoding.md`

**Issue**: Documentation shows incorrect constructor
```python
# WRONG (in docs):
encoder = RateEncoder(num_neurons=100, max_rate=100.0)

# CORRECT (actual code):
encoder = RateEncoder(max_rate=100.0)
```

**Impact**: Examples won't work, will cause errors.

### 2. **Missing New Encoder Classes** ❌

**Missing from API Reference**: 
- `TemporalEncoder` 
- `PopulationEncoder`

These classes exist in `core/encoding.py` but are not documented.

### 3. **Balanced Competitive Learning Not Documented** ❌

**Issue**: The innovation "Balanced Competitive Learning" is central to the project but not documented in:
- API Reference
- Architecture docs  
- Tutorials

**Location**: Implementation exists in `tools/balanced_competitive_learning.py`

### 4. **Import Path Inconsistencies** ❌

**Issue**: Tools use relative imports that may not work:
```python
# In tools/:
from balanced_competitive_learning import BalancedCompetitiveNetwork
```

This suggests the balanced competitive learning should be in core/ or properly importable.

### 5. **Assessment Tools Missing from Docs** ❌

**Issue**: `experiments/learning_assessment.py` exists but not documented in API reference or tutorials.

### 6. **Repository Structure Outdated** ⚠️

**File**: `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`

**Issue**: References old cleanup actions and audit dates that may be outdated for current structure.

## Recommendations

### High Priority Fixes

1. **Fix RateEncoder Documentation**
   - Update `docs/tutorials/02_sensory_encoding.md` 
   - Correct constructor parameters
   - Fix example code

2. **Document Missing Encoders**
   - Add `TemporalEncoder` to API reference
   - Add `PopulationEncoder` to API reference
   - Create usage examples

3. **Document Balanced Competitive Learning**
   - Add section to API reference
   - Create dedicated tutorial
   - Explain the innovation solution

4. **Fix Import Issues**  
   - Move `balanced_competitive_learning.py` to `core/` or create proper package structure
   - Update import paths in tools

### Medium Priority

5. **Document Assessment Framework**
   - Add `learning_assessment.py` to API reference
   - Create assessment tutorial

6. **Update Architecture Docs**
   - Remove outdated audit information
   - Focus on current architecture
   - Update directory structure

### Code Structure Issues

The documentation suggests the code has evolved significantly since docs were written:

- New encoder classes added
- Balanced competitive learning became central but isn't in core
- Assessment tools developed but not documented
- Import structure may be problematic

## Suggested Actions

1. **Immediate**: Fix RateEncoder docs (will break user examples)
2. **Soon**: Document balanced competitive learning (key feature)
3. **Next**: Restructure imports for better organization
4. **Eventually**: Full docs refresh for current architecture
