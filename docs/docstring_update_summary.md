# Docstring Update Summary - Step 2

## Completed Updates

### 1. Scripts Module
#### analyze_audit_results.py
- ✅ `load_audit_report()` - Added complete Google-style docstring with Args, Returns, Raises, and Example
- ✅ `analyze_by_module()` - Added detailed docstring explaining module analysis and priority scoring
- ✅ `get_critical_files()` - Added docstring with priority scoring explanation
- ✅ `generate_summary_report()` - Added comprehensive docstring for report generation
- ✅ `export_prioritized_list()` - Added docstring with categorization details
- ✅ `main()` - Added docstring with command-line usage example

### 2. Verification Scripts
#### verify_installation.py
- ✅ `check_module()` - Added complete docstring with type hints and examples
- ✅ `check_data_files()` - Added docstring explaining package verification
- ✅ `main()` - Added comprehensive docstring with exit codes

### 3. API Module
#### neuromorphic_api.py

##### NeuromorphicAPI Class Methods
- ✅ `connect_layers()` - Enhanced docstring with detailed Args including **kwargs, biological inspiration (STDP), and examples
- ✅ `visualize_network()` - Added complete docstring with expected dictionary keys
- ✅ `save_network()` - Added placeholder docstring with future implementation note
- ✅ `load_network()` - Added placeholder docstring with exception details

##### NeuromorphicVisualizer Class Methods
- ✅ `plot_spike_raster()` - Added detailed docstring with visualization description
- ✅ `plot_weight_evolution()` - Added docstring explaining synaptic plasticity visualization
- ✅ `plot_network_activity()` - Added docstring for heatmap visualization
- ✅ `plot_neuromodulator_levels()` - Added docstring with neuromodulator dynamics explanation
- ✅ `plot_learning_curves()` - Added docstring for training progress visualization

##### SensorimotorSystem Class Methods
- ✅ `train()` - Added comprehensive docstring with training data structure
- ✅ `run_trial()` - Added docstring explaining single trial execution
- ✅ `get_network_info()` - Added docstring with network statistics details

## Key Improvements

1. **Consistency**: All updated docstrings follow Google-style format
2. **Type Hints**: Accurate type annotations matching current implementation
3. **Biological Context**: Referenced STDP, neuromodulators, and sensory encoding where relevant
4. **Examples**: Added practical usage examples for all public methods
5. **Completeness**: Documented all parameters including **kwargs and optional parameters

## Remaining Work

Based on the audit report, there are still methods in other modules that need docstring updates:
- api/neuromorphic_system.py - Several methods need parameter documentation
- core modules - May have missing or incomplete docstrings
- archive/prototypes - Lower priority but still flagged

## Recommendations

1. Continue with remaining high-priority files from docstring_priorities.json
2. Focus on public API methods first
3. Add mathematical equations for neuron models in core.neurons module
4. Reference biological papers where models are inspired by specific research
