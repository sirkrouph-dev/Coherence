ðŸŽ‰ Task 9: Developmental Plasticity and Critical Periods
All tests passed - developmental plasticity validated!

Key features validated:
  â€¢ Age-dependent plasticity with developmental phases
  â€¢ Critical periods with enhanced plasticity windows
  â€¢ Experience-expectant and experience-dependent plasticity
  â€¢ Structural plasticity mechanisms
  â€¢ Homeostatic plasticity for activity regulation
