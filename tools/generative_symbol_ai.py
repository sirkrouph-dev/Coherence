Phase 2: Generative Symbol Creation
==================================

Following Qwen's roadmap, this implements the next evolutionary step:
Instead of choosing from a pre-written list, let the AI generate its own symbols.

Key Innovation: True emergent symbol generation via neural babbling and 
self-stabilization - no static English words.
