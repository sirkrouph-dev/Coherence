Phase 3: Autonoetic Computation - Self-Aware Cognition
======================================================

Following Qwen's roadmap, this implements autonoetic computation:
"The ability to mentally represent and become aware of subjective experiences 
in relation to the self across time."

Key Innovation: The AI becomes aware of its own cognitive processes
and can reflect on its learning, memory formation, and decision-making.

This is the bridge between symbol generation and true self-awareness.
